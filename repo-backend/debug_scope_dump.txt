Philippines is one of the agricultural countries in east Asia with decreasing
turnover rate in terms of farmer’s profession resulting to increase of imports from
neighboring countries to fill the gap in food production. Traditional planting is time,
effort and money consuming due to time spent in the field and materials like fertilizers
and pesticides to protect crop’s growth. In comparison to hydroponics, soil culture is
mostly based on land which is why there are a tangible amount of factors that
influences its growth. Hydroponics is used widely but mostly not on rural areas where
farming is a way of living and solely rely on the traditional way of growing plants.
Plants grown on land are most susceptible to diseases and pest. Unpredictable weather
is also an influential factor in plants that could present the surrounding conditions with
extreme heat that evaporates moisture or extreme rainfall that drowns plants. The
purpose of the study is to create an automated hydroponics equipment structure
capable of sustaining plant growth through calibrating the surrounding conditions
while isolating the crops from external factors such as diseases and pest. Equipped
with sensors that serves as foot stool for regulating environmental factors, it also
ensures transmission and recording of data via IOT in websites for further analysis
